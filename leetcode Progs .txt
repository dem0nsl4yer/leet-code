Array:
1. Two Sum - done - Hashmaps. 
2. Container With Most Water - done - two pointers solution 
3. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock  - done, another iteration of two pointer and two window also to solve. 
4. Product of Array Except Self - done - divide and conquer - split the problem and solve. 
5. Maximum Subarray - dynamic programming. how to iteratively think of addendum from the start. 

6. Merge Intervals
7. Rotate Array
8. Combination Sum
9. Missing Number
10. Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array

After twp pointer, prefix sum is another method to reduce time complexity. 

String:
1. Reverse String - done, temp or direct swap in string. 
2. Valid Anagram - 
3. Longest Palindromic Substring - done. DP - divide into odd/evem palin and solve/ palindromic property/just saw/ 
4. Group Anagrams - sorted and check. Count and check for every element. 
5. Valid Parentheses - done. Had to create a residual array as memory cashe. And updated it whenever had to compare for residuals. 
6. Longest Common Prefix - finding shortest term, then looking out for prefix. 
7. String to Integer (atoi)- plain labor. data parsing - char by char. string adding in python with '+' sign.

8. Palindrome Permutation
9. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
10. ZigZag Conversion


Linked List:
1. Reverse Linked List - basic LL. Pointer arithmetic. 
2. Merge Two Sorted Lists - pick val and compare, add iteratively till list exhausts. while check for nonetype directly. 
3. Add Two Numbers - using qualifier inside the loop. Using Nodemaker to plug nodes with math, rather than adding val. Dealing with residuals using % and //. 

4. Remove Nth Node From End of List
5. Intersection of Two Linked Lists
6. Linked List Cycle
7. Palindrome Linked List
8. Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List
9. Copy List with Random Pointer
10. LRU Cache

Binary Tree:
1. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree - depth traversal - BFS - recursion. 
2. Invert Binary Tree - recursion and flip. 
3. Symmetric Tree - interesting problem. split the key problem into recursion. 
4. Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal - recursion. Iterative splitting : Preorder - root-left-right // Inorder Left-root-right. 
5. Validate Binary Search Tree stuck in recursion??? unable to solve 74/82 testcases passed.  - recursion provides best solution. divide and conquer. 
- for a node how to define the constraint. then divide into left and right constraint. 

6. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree
7. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
8. Path Sum
9. Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal
10. Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List

Dynamic Programming:
1. Climbing Stairs - listing and memoization. trick is to first deploy the recursive stepping. 
2. Coin Change - Not solved yet. 

3. Longest Increasing Subsequence
4. Maximum Subarray
5. Unique Paths - easy recursion. 
6. Edit Distance - ??

7. House Robber - solved. Iterative comparisons. 
8. Longest Palindromic Subsequence
9. Word Break - unable to solve?? 
10. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock - done.
