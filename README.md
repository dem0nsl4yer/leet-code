# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems. Each solution is implemented in Python and is accompanied by a detailed explanation and approach to solving the problem.

## Structure

The repository is organized into different directories, each representing a different LeetCode problem category. Within each category, you'll find individual problem directories named after the problem's ID and title.

For example:
Each problem directory contains the following files:

- `solution.py`: The Python implementation of the solution to the problem.
- `README.md`: A detailed explanation of the problem, the approach taken to solve it, and any additional notes or insights related to the solution.

## How to Use

You can browse through the problem categories and navigate to the specific problem you are interested in. Inside each problem directory, you'll find the solution code along with the README file that provides a detailed explanation.

Feel free to explore the solutions, read the explanations, and use them as a reference to understand different problem-solving techniques and algorithms.
